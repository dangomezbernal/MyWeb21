          <p>Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.
             Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind.
             One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head.
             Others chase the charms of love, however elusive.
             What is it that drives you?
             Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.
             And men assumed a fleeting form.
             These are the roots of our world.
             Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...
             A lie will remain a lie.
